📊 Customer Churn ML – End-to-End Project

Overview

This project is an end-to-end customer churn analysis and retention prioritization system built using Python, machine learning, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The goal is to identify customers most at risk of churning, estimate the business impact of losing them, and help decision-makers prioritize retention efforts using data instead of intuition.
